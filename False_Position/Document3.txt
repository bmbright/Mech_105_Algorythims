#False Position
This function is used to find the approximate root of a function.

The alrgorithim uses false position to predict the x value of the root of an inputed funtion

Variables
Inputs
func- the funtion being evaluated
xl- the lower guess
xu- the upper guess
es- the desired relative error (defaulted to 0.0001%)
maxiter- number of iderations desired (defaulted to 200)
Outputs
root- the estimated root location
fx- the funtion evaluated at the estimated root location
ea- the approximate relative error (%)
iter- how many interations were perfrormed
